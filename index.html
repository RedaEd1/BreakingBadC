            Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is
            the fictional antihero protagonist of the American crime drama
            television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston. White
            was a skilled chemist and co-founder of a technology firm before he
            accepted a buy-out from his partners. While his partners became
            billionaires, Walter became a frustrated high-school chemistry
            teacher in Albuquerque, barely making ends meet with his family: his
            wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start
            of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walter is diagnosed
            with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walter resorts to
            manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student,
            Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to ensure his family's financial
            security after his death. Due to his chemistry training and
            production route, Walter's "blue meth" is purer than any other on
            the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade
